## 💰 **Commission Structure (CORRECTED)**

### **Salary Components**
- **Fixed Retainer**: ₹15,000/month
- **Commission**: Tiered based on monthly revenue
- **Maximum Total**: ₹60,000/month (capped)

### **Commission Tiers** ✅ FIXED
1. **₹0 - ₹50,000**: 10% commission
2. **₹50,001 - ₹100,000**: 15% commission (on excess above ₹50,000)
3. **₹100,001+**: 20% commission (on excess above ₹100,000)

### **Calculation Examples** ✅ VERIFIED
- **₹25,000 revenue**: ₹15,000 + (₹25,000 × 10%) = **₹17,500**
- **₹75,000 revenue**: ₹15,000 + (₹50,000 × 10%) + (₹25,000 × 15%) = **₹23,750**
- **₹150,000 revenue**: ₹15,000 + (₹50,000 × 10%) + (₹50,000 × 15%) + (₹50,000 × 20%) = **₹37,500**
- **₹300,000 revenue**: Commission would be ₹52,500, but total capped at **₹60,000**

## 🔄 **Real-time Synchronization**

### **Automatic Triggers**
- ✅ Invoice Created → Recalculates salary for invoice month
- ✅ Invoice Updated → Handles month changes, recalculates affected months
- ✅ Invoice Deleted → Recalculates salary for affected month
- ✅ Dashboard Refresh → Auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ✅ Pull-to-refresh → Manual sync trigger

### **Synchronization Flow**
```typescript
1. User Action (Create/Update/Delete Invoice)
2. Database Operation Executed
3. Sync Hook Triggered Automatically
4. Affected Months Identified
5. Monthly Revenue Recalculated
6. Commission Recalculated (Using Fixed Logic)
7. Salary Records Updated
8. Dashboard Data Refreshed
9. User Notified of Success/Error
```

## 🧪 **Testing & Validation**

### **Commission Calculation Tests** ✅ PASSED
```typescript
// All 12 test cases pass:
✅ Zero revenue → ₹15,000 total
✅ ₹10,000 → ₹16,000 total (10% tier)
✅ ₹50,000 → ₹20,000 total (10% tier max)
✅ ₹75,000 → ₹23,750 total (mixed 10% + 15%)
✅ ₹100,000 → ₹27,500 total (mixed tiers)
✅ ₹150,000 → ₹37,500 total (all tiers)
✅ ₹300,000 → ₹60,000 total (salary capped)
```

### **Usage Instructions**

#### Test Commission Calculations:
```typescript
import { testCommissionCalculations } from './utils/commissionTestUtils';
const results = testCommissionCalculations();
console.log(`${results.passed}/${results.total} tests passed`);
```

#### Validate Specific Revenue:
```typescript
import { validateCommissionForRevenue } from './utils/commissionTestUtils';
const validation = validateCommissionForRevenue(75000);
console.log(validation.breakdown);
// Output: (₹50,000 × 10%) + (₹25,000 × 15%) = ₹5,000 + ₹3,750 = ₹8,750
```

#### Force Data Sync:
```typescript
import { syncUtils } from './utils/syncUtils';
await syncUtils.forceFullSync();
```
